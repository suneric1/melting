# The Repo for Melting - A Interactive Installation Project

This is an interactive experience I worked on for my interactive installation class. It’s set up with a projector and a Kinect, as well as a laptop to run the application. When you walk over the Kinect, you can see your body projected on the wall as pixels, which will start melting immediately. However, you can restore your pixels by touching hands of other people who are in the same color as you. If they have different colors, touching each other would speed up the melting. If there's nobody else in the same color, you can restore by holding your hands together. Everyone’s color changes every 10 seconds, so you need to pay attention!
